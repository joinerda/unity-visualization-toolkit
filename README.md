# unity-visualization-toolkit
Toolkit for science visualization in Unity Game Engine

The UVT is designed to be able to drive the World of Data project, a visualization system built around Unity game engine.

Data Objects included regularly gridded structured data, unstructured data, and molecule data types, with file readers in CSV and WOD (World of Data) formats.

Visualization objects include glyph plots, quiver plots, volumetric plots, isocontour plots, threshhold plots, and surface plots. Additionally, UVT currently includes ball and stick rendering of molecular structures. 

Planned expansion of the UVT includes increased ability to embed 2D plots insideof the UI and in VR scenes, efficiency improvements for mobile hardware, enhanced editor features to simplify scene creation, and improvements in how meshes are handled in the case of sets with a large number of vertices.

You may use the UVT in non-commercial projects. Please let me know how you are using it so I can continue to improve it.
